# Cleaning things up

This lesson is an intermediary step between the first and last portions of the
notes app.

In the last lesson, we made a simple React Component tree that rendered a list
of information:

```javascript
var notes = [
  { id: 1, content: "Learn React" },
  { id: 2, content: "Get Lunch" },
  { id: 3, content: "Learn React Native" }
]

var Note = React.createClass({
  render() {
    return React.createElement("li", {}, this.props.content)
  }
})

var NotesList = React.createClass({
  renderNote(note) {
    return React.createElement(Note, { key: note.id, content: note.content })
  },
  render() {
    return React.createElement("ul", {}, this.props.notes.map(this.renderNote))
  }
})

var App = React.createClass({
  render() {
    var notes = this.props.notes

    return React.createElement(
      "section",
      {},
      React.createElement("h1", {}, "You have ", notes.length, " notes"),
      React.createElement(NotesList, { notes: notes })
    )
  }
})

ReactDOM.render(
  React.createElement(App, { notes: notes }),
  document.getElementById("entry-point")
)
```

By this point, calling `React.createElement` should feel tedious. Fortunately
React provides a way to make writing this code much more enjoyable.

## JSX

[JSX](https://facebook.github.io/react/docs/jsx-in-depth.html) is an extension
to JavaScript that adds a simple HTML like syntax to the language. It provides
an abstraction for describing user interface elements in JavaScript:

```javascript
// Before
React.createElement('p', {}, 'Hello, world!')

// After
<p>Hello, world</p>
```

Performing this transformation is done by a JavaScript compiler. The one we will
use is called [Babel](https://babeljs.io)

## Setting up Babel

Babel originated as a way to compile new JavaScript language features down into
older forms of code that every browser can. It also includes a JSX processor.

Normally Babel requires some command line usage or integration with a build tool
such as Make, Gulp, or Grunt. Fortunately, the project also maintains a version
that can perform code transformation in the browser; perfect for our use case.

Returning to the HTML document created in the last example, let's the browser
version of Babel to our page:

```html
...
<script src="lib/react.js"></script>
<script src="lib/react-dom.js"></script>
<script src="lib/babel.js"></script>

<!-- Alternatively: -->
<-- <script src="https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/babel-core/5.8.34/browser.js"></script> -->
...
```

Finally, change the `type` of your script tag to `"text/babel"`. This is an
important step, otherwise Babel won't touch the code.

```html
...
<script src="lib/babel.js"></script>

<script type="text/babel">
...
```

Okay! Now let's put it to use, replacing all calls to `React.createElement` with
their JSX counterparts:

```javascript
var notes = [
  { id: 1, content: "Learn React" },
  { id: 2, content: "Get Lunch" },
  { id: 3, content: "Learn React Native" }
]

var Note = React.createClass({
  render() {
    return <li>{this.props.content}</li>
  }
})

var NotesList = React.createClass({
  renderNote(note) {
    return <Note key={note.id} content={note.content} />
  },
  render() {
    return <ul>{this.props.notes.map(this.renderNote)}</ul>
  }
})

var App = React.createClass({
  render() {
    var notes = this.props.notes

    return (
      <section>
        <h1>You have {notes.length}</h1>
        <NotesList notes={notes} />
      </section>
    )
  }
})

ReactDOM.render(<App notes={notes} />, document.getElementById("entry-point"))
```

Much cleaner! By using JSX, the mental translation between what is written and
what will be rendered is much less expensive. It's also quite a bit easier to
write.

## HTML in JavaScript

JSX is one of sticking points beginners often struggle with when picking up
React. By describing HTML within JavaScript, some feel it is a violation of the
separation of concerns between markup, style, and control logic (HTML, CSS, and
JavaScript).

However _it's all the presentation layer_. Specifically, when writing
client-side applications, view templates are highly coupled to their associated
views. There is often an implicit contract created by the data they represent.
Changing one almost always leads to a change in the other.

To that end, the React community considers the separation of a view component
into a JavaScript and HTML file to be a _separation of technology_. By keeping
them together, it makes it easier to reason about the ramifications of a change.
The relationship is explicit.

## Wrapping up

This lesson was short. We focused specifically on the conversion of vanilla
React code into the JSX format. However our application is not interactive. In
the next lesson we'll explore the React event system and dig more into component
state management.
