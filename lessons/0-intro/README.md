# Introducing React

This workshop is about React Native, that means we first need to establish a
foundation with React. Over the course of the next few lessons, we'll walk
through the following:

1.  React Elements and Components
2.  Props and State
3.  JSX (JavaScript XML Syntax)
4.  Component Lifecycle Methods
5.  Events

## Heads up

We'll assume as little prior knowledge with React as possible. However we expect
a working knowledge of HTML and JavaScript. If this isn't your case, we
recommend grabbing a partner. Also feel free to ping us during the working
sessions.

If you have never worked with web technologies before. the
[Mozilla Developer Network](https://developer.mozilla.org) is a wonderful place
to start.

Additionally, there are some fantastic resources on JavaScript:

* [Eloquent Javascript](http://eloquentjavascript.net/)
* [Speaking Javascript](http://speakingjs.com/es5/)

## A Brief Tour

Create an HTML document. It can be called whatever you would like. Fill it with
the following code:

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
  <head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8" />
    <title>Introduction | Learning React</title>
    <link rel="stylesheet" href="lib/style.css" />
  </head>
  <body>
    <div id="entry-point"></div>

    <!-- Wifi might be spotty, so we've downloaded these for you: -->
    <script src="lib/react.js"></script>
    <script src="lib/react-dom.js"></script>

    <script type="text/javascript">
      // Intentionally blank. Your walk-through code will go here
    </script>
  </body>
</html>
```

There isn't too much going on here. The important part is that we include
`React` and `ReactDOM` right before our empty script block.

The React library contains the standard API for React, including the ability to
create React elements and components (we'll cover this distinction later).
ReactDOM is a _rendering engine_ for React. It basically tells React how to
build a web page using the DOM.

The DOM stands for
[Document Object Model](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Document_Object_Model),
and it is how JavaScript interacts with a web page. You won't have to interact
much (if at all) with the DOM using React.

## React Elements

The most primitive data type in React is the _element_. They are analogous to
DOM elements, even created similarly:

```javascript
var hello = React.createElement("p", null, "Hello, World!")
```

React elements are chunks of data that describe how to build a user interface.
Think of them as low level instructions; the assembly of React.

Providing `"p"` as the first argument tells React to build a paragraph tag.
We've skipped over the second argument, but it allows you to set information
like `className` and `tabIndex`. Just like `document.createElement("p")`. The
third argument, `"Hello, World!"`, is a child element. Since `"Hello, World!"`
is a string, React will automatically build a text node to represent it.

## Rendering an element

In order to actually view this element, we need to _render_ it.
`ReactDOM.render` is the function responsible for turning the React elements
into actual HTML:

```javascript
var hello = React.createElement("p", null, "Hello, World!")

// Checkout what this does by opening your HTML file in the browser
ReactDOM.render(hello, document.getElementById("entry-point"))
```

## What's happening?

Let's look at the signature of `React.createElement` from the
[React docs](https://facebook.github.io/react/docs/glossary.html#react-elements):

```html
ReactElement createElement(string/ReactClass type, [object props], [children ...])
```

1.  **string/ReactClass**: `createElement` will accept either the string name of
    an HTML element, or a React component class. We'll get into React components
    later.
2.  **[object props]**: An object of properties. For HTML elements, this could be
    something like `disabled`, `className` or `tabIndex`.
3.  **[children]**: Regular HTML elements can have children, and React elements
    are no exception. This can be any number of additional parameters passed to
    `createElement`, so `React.createElement('p', null, 'Hello, ', 'World')` is
    also totally valid.

In using `React.createElement`, we can provide low level instructions to
whatever rendering engine we chose for how to build user interfaces. We simply
model our UI in the ideal state. React decides the most efficient way to build
and update the page for us.

## Wrapping up

This concludes the first lesson. You created your first React element and
rendered into web page. We also briefly touched on React Components, props, and
some other important concepts in the React library.

In the next lesson, we'll dig deeper by building something more substantive.
